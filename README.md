## Project Brief
Build a quiz game using Redux. It's a multiple-choice quiz, so you'll need to define your own questions and a bunch of possible answers to present to your users. Work in groups of 3. 

## Project requirements 

- [x]  Ideate, Design and create this project
- [x] Use selectors to access redux state
- [x] Use dispatch to trigger redux actions
- [x] When the user selects an answer, it should show if they were correct or not.
- [x] While going through the quiz, it should show which question you're on, or how many are left
- [x]  When the user has answered all the questions, they should get to a summary screen that tells them how many they got correct or incorrect.

# Running Locally

This is a short guide on how to run a Redux quiz project locally.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
- A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the project dependencies including `react-redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, and `react-router-dom`.

## Running the Project

1. After the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the development server.
2. Once the server is started, you can view the project in your web browser by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

That's it! You now have the Redux project up and running on your local machine with all the required dependencies installed.
